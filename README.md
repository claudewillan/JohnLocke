
John Locke's Ego Network
=========

This is a repository of coorespondence data on John Locke's ego network. In the file "Locke Correspondents" you will find a .tsv file with the set of 335 correspondents, their data and metadata. In the pdf file "Locke Schema"  you will find a schema document explaining the ontology I used in compiling that .tsv file. This data is free to use and share with attribution. The Gephi file shows one example of how this data might be visualized as a network.

For more about this project, please see <a href="https://claudewillan.wordpress.com/locke/">this brief note on my blog about it</a>.
