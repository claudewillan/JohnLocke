This is a repository of coorespondence data on John Locke's ego network. In the folder "data" you will find a .tsv file with the set of 335 correspondents, their data and metadat. In the folder "schema", you will find a schema document explaining the ontology I used in compiling that .tsv file. This data is free to use and share with attribution.
